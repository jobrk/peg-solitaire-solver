# Peg solitaire solver in Rust

Solves the board using a simple **backtracking** algorithm and display the first solution as a sequence of board states.

Feel free to alterate the board to figure out solutions for other initial configurations.

## How to run

```
$ cargo run --release
```

NOTE: This is an unoptimized naive implementation, so do not expect the solver to be blazing fast.
